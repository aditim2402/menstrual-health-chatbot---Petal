Can dietary supplements help with PMS symptom relief?

Taking 1,200 milligrams (mg) of calcium a day can help reduce the physical and mood symptoms that are part of PMS. Taking magnesium supplements may help reduce water retention ("bloating"), breast tenderness, and mood symptoms. One study has shown that vitamin E may help reduce symptoms of PMS.
There are many products that are advertised to help with PMS. Most of these products have either not been tested or have not been proved to be effective. It is important to talk with your ob-gyn before taking any PMS product or supplement. Taking excess amounts of them or taking them with some medications may be harmful.
