Period problems

A period is the part of the menstrual cycle when a woman bleeds from her vagina for a few days.For most women this happens around every 28 days, but it's common for periods to be more or less frequent than this, ranging from every 21 days to every 35 days.Your period can last between 2 and 7 days, but it will usually last for about 5 days. The bleeding tends to be heaviest in the first 2 days.When your period is at its heaviest, the blood will be red. On lighter days, it may be pink or brown.You'll lose about 20 to 90ml (about 1 to 5 tablespoons) of blood during your period, although some women bleed more heavily than this.Read more about heavy periods, period pain, irregular periods and stopped or missed periods.
