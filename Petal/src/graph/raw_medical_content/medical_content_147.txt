==================================================
It usually takes about a month for the lining to build up, then break down. That is why most females get their periods around once a month.
How Does Ovulation Relate to Periods?
Ovulation (pronounced: ov-yoo-LAY-shun) is the release of an egg from the ovaries. The same hormones that cause the uterus lining to build up also cause an egg to leave one of the ovaries. The egg travels through a thin tube called a fallopian tube to the uterus.
If the egg is fertilized by a sperm cell, it attaches to the wall of the uterus, where over time it develops into a baby. If the egg is not fertilized, the uterus lining breaks down and bleeds, causing a period.
Do Periods Happen Regularly When Menstruation Starts?
For the first few years after a girl starts her period, it might not come regularly. This is normal at first. By about 2–3 years after her first period, a girl's periods should be coming around once every 4–5 weeks.
Can a Girl Get Pregnant as Soon as Her Period Starts?
Yes, a girl can get pregnant as soon as her period starts. A girl can even get pregnant right before her very first period because her hormones might already be active. The hormones may have led to ovulation and the building of the uterine wall. If so and the girl has sex, she can get pregnant, even though she has never had a period.
How Long Do Periods Last?
Periods usually last about 5 days. But a period can be shorter or last longer.
How Often Does a Period Happen?
Periods usually happen about once every 4–5 weeks. But some girls get their periods a little less or more often.
Should I Use a Pad, Tampon, or Menstrual Cup?
You have many choices about how to deal with period blood. You may need to experiment a bit to find which works best for you. Some girls use only one method and others switch between different methods.
