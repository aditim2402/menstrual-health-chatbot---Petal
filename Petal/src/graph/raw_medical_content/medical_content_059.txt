How are tampons used?

Tampons absorb menstrual blood from inside the vagina. Some tampons have a plastic or cardboard applicator tube that helps slide the tampon in place. Some tampons do not have applicators and are inserted with just your fingers.
Follow the directions inside the box to learn how to insert a tampon. It should be comfortable to wear. Once it is inserted correctly, you should not feel it. A short string attached to the end of the tampon hangs out of your vagina to help you remove it later.
Tampons come in different sizes for heavier and lighter periods. The tampon packageÂ tells you how much fluid it can absorb. A "super" tampon, for example, is thicker and is meant for heavy flow. A "slim" or "junior" tampon is slender and is meant for lighter flow.
