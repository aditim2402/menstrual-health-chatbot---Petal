Drugs that prevent ovulation, such as hormonal birth control methods, may lessen physical symptoms. But not all may relieve the mood symptoms of PMS. It may be necessary to try more than one of these medications before finding one that works.
Antidepressants can be helpful in treating PMS in some women. These drugs can help lessen mood symptoms. They can be used 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms or throughout the menstrual cycle. There are many kinds of antidepressants. If one does not work for you, your ob-gyn may prescribe another.
If anxiety is a major PMS symptom for you, an antianxiety drug can be tried if other treatments do not seem to help. Antianxiety drugs are taken as needed when you have symptoms.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can help reduce pain. Talk with your ob-gyn before taking NSAIDs. Long-term use of NSAIDs may cause stomach bleeding or ulcers.
Diuretics ("water pills") are drugs that help reduce fluid buildup. Your ob-gyn can prescribe a diuretic if water retention is a major symptom for you. Tell your ob-gyn what other drugs you are taking, especially NSAIDs. Using NSAIDs and diuretics at the same time may cause kidney problems.
