Hormones being out of balance. In a typical menstrual cycle, there's a balance between the hormones estrogen and progesterone. This controls the buildup of the lining of the uterus. The lining of the uterus also is known as the endometrium. This lining is shed during a menstrual period. When hormones are out of balance, the lining becomes too thick and sheds by way of heavy menstrual bleeding or unexpected bleeding between periods.
A number of conditions can cause hormone imbalances. These include obesity, insulin resistance, thyroid problems and polycystic ovary syndrome, which also is called PCOS.
