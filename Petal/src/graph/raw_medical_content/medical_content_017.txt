What if my pain is caused by endometriosis?

If your symptoms or a laparoscopy point to endometriosis as the cause of your period pain, your ob-gyn may recommend you try a birth control method: the pill, the implant, the injection, or the hormonal IUD. Medications called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists also may relieve endometriosis pain. GnRH agonists may cause side effects, including bone loss, hot flashes, and vaginal dryness. They usually are used for a short time. See Endometriosis to learn more.
