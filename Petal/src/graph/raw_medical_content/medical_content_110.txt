When do periods stop?
Your periods will continue until you reach the menopause, which usually happens when you are in your mid-40s to mid-50s. In the UK the average age of menopause is 51.Your periods will not usually stop suddenly when you go through the menopause. They may start to become less frequent over a few months or years before stopping altogether.


Delaying your period
It’s possible to delay your period if you take the combined contraceptive pill.How you do this depends on the type of combined pill you take. Speak to a GP or pharmacist, or a doctor or nurse at a sexual health clinic, about how to delay your period using the combined pill.If you do not take the combined pill already, you will need to start it a few weeks before the time you want to delay your period.If you do not want to take the contraceptive pill, your GP can prescribe a medicine called norethisterone to delay your periods, but this is not suitable for everyone.
