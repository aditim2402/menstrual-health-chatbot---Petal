What Causes a Period?
A period happens because of changes in 

  hormonesin the body. Hormones are chemical messengers. The ovaries release the female hormones 

  estrogenand 

  progesterone, which cause the lining of the uterus (or womb) to build up. The built-up lining is ready for a fertilized egg (an egg that has joined with a sperm) to attach to and develop into a baby. If there is no fertilized egg, the lining breaks down and bleeds. Then the same process happens all over again.
