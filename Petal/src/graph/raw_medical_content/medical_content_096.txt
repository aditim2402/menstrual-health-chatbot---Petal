Anemia. Heavy menstrual bleeding can cause anemia related to blood loss. Anemia is a condition in which the body lacks enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to tissues. The number of red blood cells is measured by hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to tissues throughout the body.
Iron deficiency anemia occurs as the body tries to make up for lost red blood cells. The body uses iron stores to make more hemoglobin so that enough oxygen can be carried to tissues. Heavy menstrual bleeding may make iron levels too low. This may result in iron deficiency anemia.
Symptoms include headaches and feeling tired. Although diet plays a role in iron deficiency anemia, the problem is made worse by heavy menstrual periods.

Severe pain. Along with heavy menstrual bleeding, you might have painful menstrual cramps. This also is known as dysmenorrhea. Talk to your doctor if your cramps make it hard to do your daily activities.
