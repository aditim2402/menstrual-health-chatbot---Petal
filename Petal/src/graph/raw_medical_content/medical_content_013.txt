What tests are done to find the cause of dysmenorrhea?

An ultrasound exam may be done when pain is not relieved with medications. In some cases, an ob-gyn may recommend a laparoscopy. This is a procedure that lets an ob-gyn view the organs in the pelvis. With laparoscopy, a small incision (cut) is made near the belly button. A thin, lighted camera—a laparoscope—is inserted into the abdomen. Laparoscopy often is done with general anesthesia in a surgery center or hospital.

How are painful periods treated?

Medications are usually the first step when treating painful periods. Certain pain relievers target prostaglandins. These medications, called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), reduce the prostaglandins made by the body and lessen their effects. This in turn makes menstrual cramps less severe. Most NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, can be bought over the counter.
