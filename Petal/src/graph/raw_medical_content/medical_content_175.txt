My Yearly Period Tracker

My Yearly Period Tracker is a simple and convenient way to track your period throughout the year.
Review the sample Yearly Period Tracker.
Print a copy of My Yearly Period Tracker.
Refer to the Key at the bottom to learn how to fill in the box with the appropriate letter(s). Place a “T” in the box for the hormone pill taken and place an “R” for reminder (placebo) pills.
Be sure to indicate if you’ve taken a pill during your period by putting a B/T or B/R in the box.
Remember to bring My Yearly Period Tracker with you to your medical appointments.
Talk to your HCP about whether you should use the monthly and/or yearly tracker to track your period.
