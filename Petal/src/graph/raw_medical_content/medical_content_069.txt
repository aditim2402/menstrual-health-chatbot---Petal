Do you know when your last menstrual period began or how long it lasted? If not, it might be time to start paying attention.
Keeping track of your menstrual cycles can help you understand what's typical for you. You also can record your ovulation and find important changes â€” such as a missed period or menstrual bleeding that isn't typical.

The menstrual cycle is the monthly series of changes the body goes through to prepare for pregnancy. Each month, one of the ovaries releases an egg. This is called ovulation. Hormonal changes at this time get the uterus ready for pregnancy. If the released egg isn't fertilized during ovulation, the lining of the uterus sheds through the vagina. This is a menstrual period.
