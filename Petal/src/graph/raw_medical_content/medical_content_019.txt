Fibroids can sometimes be removed with surgery. 


Endometriosis tissue can be removed with surgery. In some cases, the tissue returns after the surgery, but removing it can reduce the pain in the short term. Taking hormonal birth control or other medications after surgery for endometriosis may delay or prevent the return of pain. 


Hysterectomy may be done for adenomyosis if other treatments have not worked. Hysterectomy also may be recommended for other conditions when they cause severe pain. This surgery usually is a last resort.
