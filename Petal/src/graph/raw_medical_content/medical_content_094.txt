Problems with the ovaries. Sometimes ovaries don't release an egg during a menstrual cycle. This also is known as anovulation. When this happens, the body doesn't make the hormone progesterone the way it usually does during a menstrual cycle. This leads to hormone imbalance and may result in heavy menstrual bleeding or unexpected bleeding between periods.
Uterine fibroids. These tumors develop during childbearing years. They are benign, which means they are not cancerous. Uterine fibroids may cause heavier than normal menstrual bleeding or bleeding that goes on for a long time.
Polyps. These small growths on the lining of the uterus may cause menstrual bleeding that is heavy or lasts for a long time. They may cause bleeding between periods. Polyps also can cause spotting or bleeding after menopause. The growths are not cancerous.
Adenomyosis. In this condition, glands from the lining of the uterus grow into the wall of the uterus itself. This can cause heavy bleeding and painful periods.
Intrauterine device, also called an IUD. Heavy menstrual bleeding is a well-known side effect of using a hormone-free IUD for birth control. Talk to your doctor about other birth control options. IUDs with progestin may ease heavy menstrual bleeding.
Pregnancy complications. A single, heavy, late period may be due to a miscarriage. Another cause of heavy bleeding during pregnancy includes the unusual location of the placenta, which supplies nutrition to the baby and removes waste. The placenta may be too low or covering the opening of the uterus, which is called the cervix. This condition also is known as placenta previa.
Cancer. Cancer of the uterus or cervix can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, unexpected or heavy menstrual bleeding. These cancers can happen before or after menopause. Women who have had an abnormal Pap test in the past are at higher risk of cervical cancer.
Genetic bleeding disorders. Some bleeding disorders that run in families cause heavy menstrual bleeding. These include von Willebrand's disease, a condition in which the blood does not clot properly.
Medicines. Some medicines can result in heavy or lengthy menstrual bleeding. These include hormonal medicines such as birth control pills that have estrogen and progestin. These medicines typically help lessen menstrual bleeding but sometimes cause unexpected bleeding between periods. Medicines that prevent blood clots also may cause heavy menstrual bleeding. They include warfarin (Jantoven), enoxaparin (Lovenox), apixaban (Eliquis) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto).
Other medical conditions. A number of other medical conditions may cause heavy menstrual bleeding. They include liver, kidney and thyroid disease.
