Why is it a good idea to track my period?

If you track your period every month, you may notice a pattern. It may become easier to tell when you will get your next period. To track your period on a calendar, mark the first day your bleeding starts on a calendar with an "X." Put an X on each of the following days that you have bleeding. Count the first "X" as day 1. Keep counting the days until you have your next period. There are also apps that can help you track your period.
