How are pads used?

Pads are worn inside your underwear to collect your menstrual flow. They come in different sizes, styles, and thicknesses. Some have extra material on the sides called "wings" that fold over the edges of your underwear to help keep the pad in place and give better protection.
A thinner, shorter version of a pad is called a "panty liner." Some girls wear panty liners on the last days of their periods when the flow is light or on days when they think their periods will come.
Choose a pad based on your body size, the amount of flow, and what feels comfortable. Pads with deodorant may irritate your skin.

How often should I change my pad?

Change your pad at least every 4 to 8 hours or whenever it seems full or feels wet and uncomfortable. Some girls change their pads each time they urinate.
