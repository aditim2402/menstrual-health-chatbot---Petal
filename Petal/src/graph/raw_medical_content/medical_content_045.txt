==================================================
Medications often are tried first to treat heavy menstrual bleeding:

    Heavy bleeding caused by problems with ovulation, endometriosis, PCOS, and fibroids often can be managed with certain hormonal birth control methods. Depending on the type, these methods can lighten menstrual flow, help make periods more regular, or even stop bleeding completely.


Hormone therapy can be helpful for heavy menstrual bleeding that occurs during perimenopause. Before deciding to use hormone therapy, it is important to weigh the benefits and risks (increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and cancer).


Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists stop the menstrual cycle and reduce the size of fibroids. They are used only for short periods (less than 6 months). Their effect on fibroids is temporary. Once you stop taking a GnRH agonist, fibroids usually return to their original size.
