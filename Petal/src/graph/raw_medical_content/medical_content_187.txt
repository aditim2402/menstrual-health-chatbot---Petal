Are there medications that might help?
If your symptoms don’t improve with a few nutrition and lifestyle changes, talk with your health care provider (HCP). They may be able to prescribe medicine that will help lessen or get rid of your discomforts. There are many different medicines that are currently used to treat PMS symptoms. The most commonly prescribed are oral contraceptives (birth control pills) which prevent ovulation and keep hormone levels even. Most pills (particularly those that are low in progestin or contain drospirenone) can improve symptoms. Sometimes symptoms can improve even more if the pill is taken continuously (one active pill every day and no placebo pills). Other medications such as ibuprofen or naproxen sodium  can help to relieve lower back discomfort and headaches.  A mild diuretic such as Spironolactone can lessen bloating and mood changes. If depression is a significant issue, your health care provider may prescribe antidepressants such as Fluoxetine, Sertraline, or other SSRI medicines either for the 7 days before your period or daily.
Are there vitamins or minerals that will improve my symptoms?
Although more research studies are needed, there are certain vitamins and minerals that may help PMS symptoms. Several research studies show that calcium can significantly decrease many of the symptoms associated with PMS. Make sure that you are getting the recommended 1300 mg/day from calcium-rich foods or drinks or from supplements. Other supplements that could help with PMS symptoms are magnesium (400 mg/day), vitamin B6 (100 mg/day), and vitamin E (400 IU/day), but more research is needed. Check with your health care provider about whether you should try them and how much you should take because taking high doses of supplements can have unpleasant or dangerous side effects. For example, high doses of magnesium may cause diarrhea in some people.
Sometimes other medical conditions can mimic or act like PMS symptoms, so it’s important to keep your health care provider up-to-date with any health issues you are having. If your PMS symptoms are so severe that you feel very depressed, talk with a parent, guardian, or trusted adult, and make an appointment with your health care provider as soon as possible.
