How can heavy menstrual bleeding affect my health?

Heavy menstrual bleeding may be a sign of an underlying health problem that needs treatment. Blood loss from heavy periods also can lead to a condition called iron-deficiency anemia. Severe anemia can cause shortness of breath and increase the risk of heart problems.

What causes heavy menstrual bleeding?

Many things can cause heavy menstrual bleeding. Some of the causes include the following:


Fibroids and polyps


Adenomyosis


Irregular ovulation—If you do not ovulate regularly, areas of the endometrium (the lining of the uterus) can become too thick. This condition is common during puberty and perimenopause. It also can occur in women with certain medical conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and hypothyroidism.

    Bleeding disorders—When the blood does not clot properly, it can cause heavy bleeding.
