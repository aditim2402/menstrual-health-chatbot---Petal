What causes PMS?
Scientists are still trying to figure out what causes PMS. We know that during the second half of the menstrual cycle, progesterone (female hormone) levels increase. Then, just before the period comes, progesterone and estrogen (another female hormone) levels drop. It is believed that changes in hormone levels result in PMS symptoms. Other factors may have an effect on PMS symptoms; for example, you may notice that your symptoms are better if you get plenty of sleep and exercise regularly. Although PMS can be frustrating, there are things you can do that may help relieve your symptoms.
Are there any tests to check for PMS?
There are no specific tests such as a blood test to diagnose PMS. The diagnosis is based on specific symptoms. Your health care provider (HCP)will likely ask you a lot of questions. Some questions will be about your period and when you have symptoms, how long they last, etc. and if your symptoms get better or disappear when your period starts. Your HCP will also ask about what medicines you take including any over-the-counter medicine, vitamins and dietary supplements. They  may order tests to make sure your symptoms are not caused by another condition such as a problem with your thyroid gland. Also, your HCP may ask you if you have ever been treated for a mood or anxiety disorder, substance abuse, headaches, chronic fatigue or other medical conditions that can sometimes get worse a few days before a  menstrual period.
