When Should I Call the Doctor?
Most girls don't have any problems with their periods. But call your doctor if you:

are 15 and haven't started your period
have had your period for more than 2 years and it's still not regular (coming about every 4–5 weeks)
have bleeding between periods
have severe cramps that don't get better with ibuprofen or naproxen 
have very heavy bleeding (bleeding that goes through a pad or tampon faster than every 1 hour)
have periods that last more than about a week
have severe PMS that gets in the way of your everyday activities

What Else Should I Know?
Periods are a natural, healthy part of life. They shouldn't get in the way of exercising, having fun, and enjoying life. If you have questions about periods, ask your doctor, a parent, health teacher, school nurse, or older sister.
