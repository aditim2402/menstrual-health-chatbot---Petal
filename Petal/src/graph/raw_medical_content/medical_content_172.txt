Puberty is the time when your body changes because of hormones produced by your ovaries. Puberty usually starts between age 8 and 13 and includes growth of your breasts, the appearance of hair in your genital and underarm areas, and a growth spurt in your height. You may also notice that you have body odor and some discharge in your vaginal area from the effect of the hormones. Usually your menstrual periods will start about 2 to 3 years after you notice the first signs of breast development. The age when you start puberty may be earlier or later than others your age because late or early puberty may run in your family. Puberty may start earlier in girls who are overweight and later in girls who are underweight or involved in sports or activities such as dance, gymnastics or track.
