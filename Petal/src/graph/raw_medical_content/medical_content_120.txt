Treatments for irregular periods
Treatment is not always needed for irregular periods.The GP may refer you to a specialist (gynaecologist) if you need tests to find out what's causing your irregular periods. If treatment is needed it will depend on the cause.For example, if a condition like polycystic ovary syndrome is causing irregular periods, the combined pill may help make your periods more regular.
