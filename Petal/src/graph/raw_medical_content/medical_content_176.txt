What if I skip a period?
If you miss your period, it could be because of a change in your body or in your life. If you are under stress, you’ve been sick, you are exercising a lot, or you’ve lost weight, you may skip a period. It is common to skip a period every once in a while, especially during the first year that you are getting it. However, if you are having unprotected sexual intercourse or close sexual contact, or if your birth control method has failed, it could also mean that you are pregnant. If you think you may be pregnant, it is very important to see your HCP. If you skip many periods, you should talk to your healthcare provider and see why this is happening.
What if I have big clots of blood during my period?
Small, dark, chunky clots of blood can be normal. Some women get them during their period when they have days of heavy cramping and heavy bleeding. Your body usually makes things called “anti-coagulants” that keep your blood from clotting as it moves to your vagina and out of your body. But during days of heavy bleeding and cramping, the blood may be leaving the uterus so quickly there isn’t time to release these anti-coagulants. The blood then clots. If you have clots that are bigger than the size of a quarter, talk with your HCP.
What if I get spots of blood on my underwear between my periods?
Bleeding in the middle of your cycle could mean different things. Some individuals bleed a little bit during the middle of their cycle, when they ovulate (when a mature egg is released from your ovaries, the hormone levels may decrease a little). This is nothing to worry about. Other times, “spotting” occurs because of an infection such as a sexually transmitted infection. Very rarely, “spotting” can be because of a polyp or fibroid, but this is not very common. You should talk to your HCP if you have bleeding when you don’t have your period.
Remember to keep track of your menstrual periods and check in with your health care provider if your bleeding pattern changes.
