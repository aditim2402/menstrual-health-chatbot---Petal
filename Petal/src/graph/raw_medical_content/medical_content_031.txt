Simple changes in your diet may help relieve the symptoms of PMS:

    Eat a diet rich in complex carbohydrates. A complex carbohydrate-rich diet may reduce mood symptoms and food cravings. Complex carbohydrates are found in foods made with whole grains, like whole wheat bread, pasta, and cereals. Other examples are barley, brown rice, beans, and lentils.

    Add calcium-rich foods, like yogurt and leafy green vegetables, to your diet.

    Reduce your intake of fat, salt, and sugar.

    Avoid caffeine and alcohol.

    Change your eating schedule. Eat six small meals a day rather than three large ones, or eat slightly less at your three meals and add three light snacks. Keeping your blood sugar level stable will help with symptoms.
