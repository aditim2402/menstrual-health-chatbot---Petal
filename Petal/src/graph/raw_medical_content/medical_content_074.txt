What can I do to prevent irregularities?


Sometimes, birth control pills can help make an irregular menstrual cycle more regular. Birth control devices that contain progestin can make periods less heavy and ease cramping. Treatment for any problems that may cause these irregularities, such as an eating disorder, also might help. However, some menstrual irregularities can't be prevented.
In addition, talk with your health care provider if:

Your periods suddenly stop for more than 90 days â€” and you're not pregnant.
Your periods become irregular after having been regular.
You bleed for more than seven days.
You bleed more heavily than usual or soak through more than one pad or tampon every hour or two.
Your periods are less than 21 days or more than 35 days apart.
You bleed between periods.
You develop severe pain during your period.
You suddenly get a fever and feel sick after using tampons.
