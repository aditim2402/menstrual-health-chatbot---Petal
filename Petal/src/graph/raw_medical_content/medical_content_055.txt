When will I start my period?

Most girls start their periods between the ages of 12 and 13, but some start earlier or later. Your period usually starts about 2 to 3 years after your breasts start to grow.

How long do periods last?

When you first start having your period, it may last only a few days. Your first few periods may be very light. You may only see a few spots of reddish brown blood. Anywhere from 2 to 7 days is normal. If your period lasts for more than 7 days, you should talk with your doctor.

How often will I get my period?

A menstrual cycle is counted from the first day of bleeding in one month to the first day of bleeding in the next month. The average menstrual cycle is about 28 days, but cycles that are 21 to 45 days are also normal. It may take 6 years or more after your period starts for your cycle to get regular.
