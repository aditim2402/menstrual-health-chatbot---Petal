How can I track my menstrual cycle?


To find out what's typical for you, start keeping a record of your menstrual cycle on a calendar. Begin by tracking your start date every month for several months in a row to identify the regularity of your periods.
If you're worried about your periods, also track the following every month: 

End date. How long does your period typically last? Is it longer or shorter than usual?
Flow. Record the heaviness of your bleeding. Does it seem lighter or heavier than usual? How often do you need to change your tampon or pad? Have you passed any blood clots?
Bleeding changes. Are you bleeding in between periods?
Pain. Describe any pain you have with your period. Does the pain feel worse than usual? It is not unusual to have some cramping or pain with your periods.
Other changes. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or behavior? Did anything new happen around the time you noticed changes in your periods?
