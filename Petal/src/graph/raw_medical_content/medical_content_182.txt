PMS stands for Premenstrual Syndrome; “pre” means “before” and “menstrual” refers to the menstrual cycle or periods. Not all girls will get PMS. Most girls and women with PMS have symptoms during the week before their period that lessen or disappear within 1-2 days after their period starts. Symptoms can usually be treated with lifestyle changes such as exercise and relaxation therapy and over-the-counter medicine. If these aren’t effective, prescription medicines are sometimes prescribed.
PMDD stands for Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder. This diagnosis is reserved for young and adult women who have: five or more of the most common PMS symptoms during the week before their period, for at least two menstrual cycles in a row, and symptoms are not due to a medical condition such as thyroid disease. Symptoms such as mood swings, irritability, depression and fatigue are usually so severe that the young/adult woman misses school, work and/or avoids her regular social activities.
How do I know if I have PMS symptoms?
PMS symptoms usually occur 5-7 days before a girl/woman’s menstrual period. There are actually a total of 150 known symptoms of PMS. The most common symptoms include: mood swings, breast soreness, bloating, acne, cravings for certain foods, increased hunger and thirst, and fatigue. Other symptoms may include constipation or diarrhea, irritability, and feeling blue or down in the dumps. If you have any of these symptoms and they happen during the week before your period starts and go away when your period arrives or a few days later, you may have PMS. If you feel blue or down in the dumps and these feelings last longer than the week before your period, it’s probably not related to PMS. In this situation, it’s particularly important to ask your primary care provider if you should talk to a counselor or therapist.
Since there are so many possible symptoms of PMS, it’s a good idea to keep track of them. Remember to note if the symptoms are mild, moderate, or severe. Use a period and symptom tracker for 2-3 months and then bring it to your next medical appointment. A record of your symptoms can help your health care provider figure out the best treatment choices for you.
