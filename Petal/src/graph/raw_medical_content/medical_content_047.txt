==================================================
If medication does not reduce your bleeding, a surgical procedure may be recommended:


Endometrial ablation destroys the lining of the uterus. It stops or reduces menstrual bleeding. Pregnancy is not likely after ablation, but it can happen. If it does, the risk of serious complicationsÂ is greatly increased. You will need to use a birth control method until after menopause following endometrial ablation. Sterilization (permanent birth control) may be a good option to prevent pregnancy for women having ablation. Endometrial ablation should be considered only after medication or other therapies have not worked.


Uterine artery embolization (UAE) is used to treat fibroids. In UAE, the blood vessels to the uterus are blocked, which stops the blood flow that allows fibroids to grow.


Myomectomy is surgery to remove fibroids without removing the uterus.
    Hysteroscopy can be used to remove fibroids or stop bleeding caused by fibroids in some cases.
