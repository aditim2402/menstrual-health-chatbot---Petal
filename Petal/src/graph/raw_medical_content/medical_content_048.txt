Hysteroscopy can be used to remove fibroids or stop bleeding caused by fibroids in some cases.


Hysterectomy is surgical removal of the uterus. Hysterectomy is used to treat fibroids and adenomyosis when other types of treatment have failed or are not an option. It also is used to treat endometrial cancer. After the uterus is removed, a woman will no longer have periods andÂ can no longer get pregnant.
