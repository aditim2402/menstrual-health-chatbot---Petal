Changes in your periods
Your periods can change – for example, they may last longer or get lighter. This does not necessarily mean there's a problem, but it does need to be investigated.You can see your GP, or visit your nearest women's clinic or contraceptive clinic.Bleeding between periods, bleeding after having sex, or bleeding after the menopause needs to be checked by a doctor.It might be caused by an infection, abnormalities in the neck of the womb (the cervix) or, in rare cases, it could be cancer.You could be pregnant if you miss a period and you've had sex. See your GP if you've taken a pregnancy test and the result is negative (you're not pregnant) and you've missed 3 consecutive periods.They will investigate the cause and recommend any necessary treatment.Read more about stopped or missed periods.
