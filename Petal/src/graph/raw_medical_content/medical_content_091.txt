Fibroid locations
There are three main types of uterine fibroids. Intramural fibroids grow within the wall of the uterus. Submucosal fibroids grow into the space inside the uterus. Subserosal fibroids grow on the outside of the uterus. Some submucosal or subserosal fibroids hang from a stalk inside or outside of the uterus. This is called a pedunculated fibroid.

Uterine polyps
Uterine polyps attach to the uterus by a large base or a thin stalk. They can grow to be several centimeters in size. Uterine polyps can cause irregular menstrual bleeding, bleeding after menopause, very heavy menstrual flow or bleeding between periods.
