==================================================
Lifestyle Changes:

Fit in exercise. Do aerobic exercise (such as running, dancing, or jump roping) for 30-60 minutes a day, 4 to 6 times a week.
Catch your ZZZ’s. If you’re a teen, you need about 9 hours of sleep each night.
Try to maintain a regular schedule. This includes meals, exercise, and bedtime.
Keep stress to a minimum. If possible, try to schedule events that you think could be stressful during the week after your period.
Avoid alcohol. Drinking alcohol before your period can make you feel more depressed.
