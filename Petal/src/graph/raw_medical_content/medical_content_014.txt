How are NSAIDs used?

NSAIDs work best if taken at the first sign of your period or pain. You usually take them for only 1 or 2 days. Women with bleeding disorders, asthma, aspirin allergy, liver damage, stomach disorders, or ulcers should not take NSAIDs. 

What other medical approaches can help with painful periods?

Birth control methods that contain estrogen and progestin, such as the pill, the patch, and the vaginal ring, can be used to treat painful periods. Birth control methods that contain progestin only, such as the birth control implant and the injection, also may reduce period pain.
