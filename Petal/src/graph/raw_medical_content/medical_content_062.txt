What if I am having heavy bleeding?

If you are bleeding so much that you need to change your pad or tampon every 1 to 2 hours or if your period lasts for more than 7 days, you should see your doctor. See your doctor right away if you are light-headed, dizzy, or have a racing pulse. Read Heavy and Abnormal Periods to learn more.

What if I have irregular periods?

You should tell your doctor if your periods are usually regular but then become irregular for several months. You should also see your doctor if your period comes more often than every 21 days or less often than every 45 days. Read Heavy and Abnormal Periods to learn more.

When else should I talk with my doctor?

Menstrual periods are a normal, healthy part of life. But having a period should not interfere with your daily activities. If you have any questions or concerns about your period, talk them over with a parent or doctor.
