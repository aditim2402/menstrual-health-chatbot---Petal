Period products
Period products soak up or collect the blood released during your period. The main types of period products are:padstamponsmenstrual cupsPadsPads are strips of padding that have a sticky side you attach to your underwear to hold them in place. One side of the pad is made of an absorbent material that soaks up the blood.Pads come in many sizes, so you can choose one to suit how heavy or light your period is.You can also get reusable washable pads.Pantyliners are a smaller and thinner type of pad that can be used on days when your period is very light.TamponsTampons are small tubes of cotton wool that you insert into your vagina to soak up the blood before it comes out of your body.There are 2 types of tampon – ones that come with an applicator and others without an applicator that you insert with your fingers. In both cases, there's a string at one end of the tampon, which you pull to remove it.Tampons come with instructions that explain how to use them. If the tampon is inserted correctly, you should not be able to feel it inside you. If you can feel it or it hurts, it might not be in properly.It is not possible for a tampon to get lost inside you. Your vagina holds it firmly in place and it expands inside you as it soaks up the blood.Menstrual cupsMenstrual cups are an alternative to pads and tampons. The cup is made from silicone and you put it inside your vagina.Menstrual cups collect the blood rather than absorb it. Unlike tampons and most pads, which are thrown away after they've been used, you can wash menstrual cups and use them again.Period underwearPeriod underwear are pants made from absorbent fabric. They soak up blood in the same way as pads, and have a layer to prevent leaks. They're designed to be washed and reused.
