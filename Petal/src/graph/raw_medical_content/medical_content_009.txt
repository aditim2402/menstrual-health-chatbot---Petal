There are two types of dysmenorrhea: primary and secondary.

What is primary dysmenorrhea?

Primary dysmenorrhea is the cramping pain that comes before or during a period. This pain is caused by natural chemicals called  prostaglandins that are made in the lining of the  uterus. Prostaglandins cause the muscles and blood vessels of the uterus to contract. On the first day of a period, the level of prostaglandins is high. As bleeding continues and the lining of the uterus is shed, the level goes down. This is why pain tends to lessen after the first few days of a period.

At what age does period pain start?

Primary dysmenorrhea begins soon after a girl starts having menstrual periods. In many women with primary dysmenorrhea, periods become less painful as they get older. This type of period pain also may improve after giving birth.
