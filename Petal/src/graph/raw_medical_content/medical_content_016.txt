What can I do at home to manage my period pain?

Exercise—Exercising most days of the week can make you feel better. Aerobic workouts, such as walking, jogging, biking, or swimming, help produce chemicals that block pain. 


Apply heat—Taking a warm bath or placing a heating pad or hot water bottle on your abdomen can be soothing. 


Sleep—Getting enough sleep before and during your period is important. Being well rested can help you cope with discomfort. 


Relax—Meditating or practicing yoga also can help you cope with pain.
